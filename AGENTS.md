# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- apps/web: Next.js app (primary product). Uses Prisma, TRPC, Tailwind.
- apps/marketing: Public marketing site (Next.js, static export).
- apps/docs: Mintlify docs content.
- packages/\*: Shared libraries (email-editor, ui, eslint-config, tailwind-config, typescript-config, sdk).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pnpm i`: Install workspace deps (Node >= 20).
- `pnpm dev`: Turbo dev for all relevant apps (loads `.env`).
- `pnpm start:web:local`: Run only `apps/web` locally on port 3000.
- `pnpm build`: Turbo build across the monorepo.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Files: React components PascalCase (e.g., `AppSideBar.tsx`); folders kebab/lowercase.
- Paths (web): use alias `~/` for src imports (e.g., `import { x } from "~/utils/x"`).
- NEVER USE DYNAMIC IMPORTS. ALWAYS IMPORT ON THE TOP

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Prefer Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`). Git history shows frequent feat/fix usage.
- PRs must include: clear description, linked issues, screenshots for UI changes, migration notes, and verification steps.
- never run build,migration commands unless asked for
